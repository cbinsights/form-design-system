# System Messages

A "System Message" is a piece of UI that speaks to a user on behalf of CBI or the
application itself. System messages come in many shapes and sizes; each type of message is
designed for a specific use case (see below). FDS provides React components for Toasts and
Prompts. Banners and Marketing messages should be handled at the application level.

| Message type  | When to use it                                                                         |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Banner**    | Information pretaining to site-wide impact (e.g. expired trial, scheduled downtime)    |
| **Toast**     | Provide feedback for user actions (e.g. progress, warnings, errors, success)           |
| **Prompt**    | Prompting for user feedback. Typically used to confirm a user action ("Are you sure?") |
| **Marketing** | e.g. Billy, Pendo, and other tools used for education, onboarding, or sales            |

## Banner

<img src={imgBanner} alt="example Banner" style={{ maxWidth: '600px' }} />

_Banners should only be used to convey important messages. If there is something
actionable for the user, include a link or button in the banner._

### Examples

- Trial expired
- Scheduled downtime
- Ongoing incidents or other service disruptions

## Toast

<img src={imgToast} alt="example Toast" style={{ maxWidth: '600px' }} />

_Toasts animate up from the bottom left of the viewport. By default, a Toast notification
will dismiss itself after about four seconds._

### Give users time to read

- Keep toast messages short and concise
- For longer messages, disable auto dismissal

### Provide an action

- For error Toasts, include a retry action whenever possible
- For success Toasts, provide a link whenever possible (e.g. "Go to Collection")
- For progress Toasts, include a cancel action if possible

## Prompt

<img src={imgPrompt} alt="example Prompt" style={{ maxWidth: '600px' }} />

_A Prompt is a modal dialog that solicits user feedback. Prompts are typically used to
confirm a destructive user action._

### Make choices clear to the user

- The primary/confirmation action should always be the rightmost button
- The primary/confirmation action should always use a high contrast button style
- The secondary/cancel action should always use a low contrast button style
- Destructive actions, such as deletion, should always use a destructive style button

### Use simple, direct language

##### Put the most important information in the title:

<CopyExample
  invalid="Are you sure you want to delete this Collection?"
  valid="This will permanently delete your Collection"
/>

##### Buttons should be direct, following UI copy guidelines:

<CopyExample invalid="Yes, delete Collection" valid="Delete Collection" />

### Give the user a way out

- **All user responses should close the prompt immediately**
- Any Prompt dismissal action taken by the user should be interpreted as "cancel"
- Feedback, such as error or success messages should be handled outside of the Prompt, in a
  Toast message.
