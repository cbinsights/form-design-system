# UI Copy Guidelines

Guidelines for writing copy that appears in product user interface (web and mobile applications).
When writing non-interface copy, please refer to IU guidelines.

## Capitalization

Generally prefer sentence case. When in doubt, don't capitalize.

### Headings

Use title case in main headings. The main heading is typically the biggest heading on the page or app view.

<CopyExample
  valid="Market Size Estimates and Related Markets"
  invalid="Market size estimates and related markets"
/>

### Subheadings

Subheadings should be sentence case. Do not title case a heading unless it's the top-level heading on a page/view.

<CopyExample
  invalid="Top Investors Related to Your Search"
  valid="Top investors related to your search"
/>

### Short descriptions

Short descriptions (e.g. toast messages, tooltips, table cell values) should be in sentence case without a period. If the short description is more than one sentence, use periods.

<CopyExample
  valid="An error occurred loading your Stories"
  invalid="An Error Occurred Loading Your Stories"
/>

### Tables

For table headings and values, prefer sentence casing.

<CopyExample valid="Last updated" invalid="Last Updated" />

### Charts

Always title case chart titles.

<CopyExample valid="Mentions in Earnings Calls" invalid=" Mentions in earnings calls" />

### Calls to action

CTAs should be in sentence case. Buttons may be in all caps or sentence case.

<CopyExample valid="Reload page" invalid="Reload Page" />

### People/roles

Do not capitalize roles or job titles. For example, the role of "administrator" does not describe a deity, mythic figure, or a proper noun.

<CopyExample
  valid="Contact your team administrator"
  invalid="Contact your team Administrator"
/>

### Entities

Case specific companies and investors with original casing (e.g. "Locus Biosciences"). Do not capitalize identifiers like the words "company" and "investor".

<CopyExample
  valid="Showing 1-25 of 210 companies"
  invalid="Showing 1-25 of 210 Companies"
/>

### Product features

Always capitalize major features on the CBI platform. When in doubt, ask the product marketing team.

<CopyExample valid="Your Stories" invalid="Your stories" />

## Punctuation

### Exclamation points

Use sparingly, only for positive messages where the user might be as excited as we are. DO NOT use exclamation points in error messages.

<CopyExample
  valid="An error occurred loading your Stories"
  invalid="An error occurred loading your Stories!"
/>

### Periods

Periods are not necessary in most user interface copy. Avoid periods unless the copy contains more than one sentence.

<CopyExample
  valid="Monitor and track updates to companies in your portfolio"
  invalid="Monitor and track updates to companies in your portfolio."
/>

### Serial commas

Always use a serial comma.

<CopyExample invalid="Pål, Paul and Kristin" valid="Pål, Paul, and Kristin" />

### Ampersands

Avoid ampersands in UI copy. Spell out "and".

<CopyExample invalid="Clone & view Collection" valid="Clone and view Collection" />

### Numbers

Use figures for paging and denoting a number of items the user is interacting with (e.g. "3 rows selected").

<CopyExample valid="Showing 20 results" invalid="Showing twenty results" />

### Time and date

By default, use American English notation for shorthand dates. Show leading zeros.

<CopyExample valid="MM/DD/YYYY" />

Do not abbreviate month name. if the copy doesn't fit, change the design to allow text wrapping or use a shorthand date instead.

<CopyExample invalid="Aug 22, 2019" valid="August 22, 2019" />

## Calls to action

Avoid unnecessary instruction in calls to action. Keep CTAs clear and concise.

<CopyExample invalid="Click to create Collection" valid="Create Collection" />

Use an active voice for actions instead of a passive voice. Use verbs.

<CopyExample invalid="New page" valid="Add page" />

Buttons, menu items, and other clickable copy should describe the action in the first two words.

<CopyExample invalid="Yes, delete column" valid="Delete column" />
