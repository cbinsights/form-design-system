# Naming Conventions
‚úèÔ∏è Use these guidelines to ensure styles and components are named with consistency and
clarity.

## Sizes

For specifying size abstractions in JS, CSS, or dictionary properties, use these shirt sizes:

```
xs
s
m
l
xl
2xl
3xl
4xl
```

## Dictionary variables
Variables generated by `style-dictionary` are based on the object structure of json files
in `src/dictionary/properties`.

Because most of these properties resolve to CSS _values_, it is preferred to use the
CSS _property_ name in variables:

```
--font-color-primary
--zindex-modal
--color-red
```


## Components

Use `PascalCase` for component names.

```diff
-<Menubutton />
+<MenuButton />
```

Prefer simple component names. Namespacing is unnecessary.

```diff
-<FdsButton />
+<Button />
```

Prefer props for declaring variants instead of separate components.

```diff
-<PrimaryButton />
-<SecondaryButton />
+<Button type="primary|secondary" />
```

When there is a parent-child relationship between two components, make that relationship
explicit through naming:

```diff
-<Item /> /* üí≠ what kind of item? */
+<FlexItem /> /* üí≠ this looks like a child of a `Flex`! */
```

## Props

Props for event handlers should include an `on` prefix:

```diff
-hover
+onHover
```

Boolean props should have an auxiliary verb prefix _unless_ the boolean prop maps directly
to a boolean html attribute:

```diff
-selected
+isSelected

-closeButton
+hasCloseButton

-portal
+usePortal
```

```diff
+checked
+disabled
```

When a prop expects a React component instead of a primitive, use `PascalCase`:

```diff
-icon
+Icon
```

Props that accept a list of items should always be plural:

```diff
-list={['thing one', 'thing two']}
+listItems={['thing one', 'thing two']}
```

Always name rest props `rest`:

```diff
-const Component = ({ foo, bar, ...props})
-const Component = ({ foo, bar, ...otherProps})
+const Component = ({ foo, bar, ...rest})
```

Props that accept a component _reference_ should be uppercase:

```diff
-icon={CloudIcon}
+ Icon={CloudIcon} // CloudIcon is a reference to the imported icon component
```

## CSS classes
In FDS, we follow a modified BEM naming convention. With our convention, hyphens carry the
meaning for block-element relationships and underscores are reserved for conditional
classes.

```css
/* parent-child */
.base-child {}

/* modifier */
.base--modifier {}

/* child modifier */
.base-child--modifier {}

/* conditional (not in use yet) */
.condition_base--modifier {}
```

#### Base
The word at the beginning of a class name is the "base" of the class. This could
refer to an element, a CSS property, or a concept as a standalone entity.

CSS properties as "base":

- **`.margin`**`--top`
- **`.fontSize`**`--xl`
- **`.color`**`--red`

Concepts that do not map to a single CSS property can also be a "base" name:

- **`.flush`**`--all`
- **`.childAlign`**`--center--center`
- **`.media`**`--xl`


#### Child
Parent-child relationships are denoted by a single hyphen. This allows us to keep our
selectors flat (a single class without ancestry) while providing a hint that the selector
is in some way related to a parent element.

```css
.flex-flexItem {} /* the flexItem is a child of "flex" */
.button-icon {} /* this is for an icon element that is a child of a "button" */
```

#### Modifier
A double hyphen indicates the class modifies some style property.

- `.flush`**`--all`**
- `.media`**`--xl`**
- `.menu-item`**`--selected`**

#### Conditional
Some classes may apply their styles conditionally based on browser support, viewport size,
or other contextual condition. We indicate this with a prefix and underscore at the
beginning of the class name.

‚ö†Ô∏è  The classes below are examples only. For a full list of available utility classes, see [base styles documentation](https://cbinsights.github.io/form-design-system/fds-styles/).

- **`.atMedium_`**`margin--all` (adds margin to all sides when the viewport reaches the
- medium breakpoint)
- **`.atLarge_`**`display--block` (sets display to block when the viewport reaches the
- large breakpoint)
